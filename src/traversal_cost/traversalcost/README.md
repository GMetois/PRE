# Python package description

**traversalcost** is a custom Python package to help to extract features from signals, compute traversal costs from them and display the results.

It contains the following files:

* **features.py**: functions used to extract features from a signal
* **fourier.py**: functions to help when dealing with frequency-domain features
* **utils.py**: some useful functions to compute features, traversal costs and to display the results
* **wavelets.py**: functions to help when working with wavelets transforms (DWT, CWT, WST)
